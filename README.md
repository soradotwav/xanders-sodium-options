# Xander's Sodium Options: Continued

**A community continuation of Xander's Sodium Options**, replacing the Sodium options GUI with a Vanilla-style alternative powered by [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).

> Originally created by [isXander](https://github.com/isXander). This version supports Minecraft 1.21.6+. Looking for older versions? Check the [original mod page](https://modrinth.com/mod/xanders-sodium-options).

It has a wide range of support for various mods which integrate with Sodium, such as:
-   [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)
-   [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra)
-   [More Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/moreculling)
-   [Cull Less Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-less-leaves)
-   [EntityViewDistance](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-view-distance)

Any other mods which integrate with Sodium's GUI will *likely work* as well. If you encounter any issues, please [report them here](https://github.com/soradotwav/xanders-sodium-options/issues) and/or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TKzfYvmcYh).
